# Non-Euclidean Geometry to Expand Virtual Spaces (NEGEVS)
Independent Study Project at Stevens Institute of Technology to solve the issue of broken immersion in Virtual Reality with virtual environments larger than a player's physical play area. With non-Euclidean geometry, we can expand bounded play areas to allow players to explore an infinite amount of virtual space, eliminating this broken immersion.
