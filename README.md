# Non-Euclidean Geometry to Expand Virtual Spaces (NEGEVS)
Independent Study Project at Stevens Institute of Technology (Spring 2022) to solve the issue of broken immersion in Virtual Reality with virtual environments larger than a player's physical play area.

Currently, the only way to explore an environment larger than a player's room-scale play area is to have a player teleport themselves around the virtual world, entirely breaking the immersion of VR. To solve this, we implement non-Euclidean geometry through the use of seamless portals. With non-Euclidean geometry, we can expand bounded play areas to allow players to explore an infinite amount of virtual space, holding the immersion of reaching new areas by just walking around a player's room.
